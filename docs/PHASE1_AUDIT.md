# Phase 1 Audit Report

## Scope

This audit covers the current monorepo state for Homeshare v2, with emphasis on Phase 1 readiness (environment setup, service bootstrapping, and deployment prerequisites).

## Current Strengths

- Monorepo structure is in place with frontend, backend, and contracts packages.
- Environment templates exist for all packages.
- Contract deployment scripts and Hardhat config are present.

## Gaps and Risks

### Environment Configuration
- Backend and contracts use `dotenv.config()` which loads from `.env`, while the setup guide previously referenced `.env.local`.
- Placeholder values remain for RPC keys, contract addresses, and token addresses.
- Canton chain IDs and explorer URLs are still empty.

### Backend Implementation
- API routes for auth, properties, tokens, and investments contain TODO placeholders and currently return stub responses.

### Contract Configuration
- Base/Canton contract addresses are zero-address placeholders in env templates.
- Canton chain IDs are not defined, which will block deployment configuration.

## Phase 1 Action Plan (Started)

1. **Environment bootstrap script**: Added a single script to create `.env`/`.env.local` files and highlight placeholders.
2. **Setup guide alignment**: Updated docs to match actual `.env` usage.

## Next Recommended Phase 1 Steps

1. Fill in RPC URLs and keys for chosen networks (Sepolia/Base Sepolia to start).
2. Deploy contracts to testnets and update env contract addresses.
3. Confirm database connectivity and create the initial schema/migrations.
4. Wire backend to actual contract addresses and complete the TODO API handlers.

## Notes

- For immediate development, testnets (Sepolia/Base Sepolia) are recommended.
- Canton network configuration requires chain ID and explorer URL to proceed.
